# Talk Hub

Talk Hub is chat application where the user can sign up for his own account and can login into the application. Once logged in, the user will be able to send friend requests to the suggested users. The users to which the request has been sent can accept the friend request and then they will be visible in the friends list and both the users will be able to interact with each other through messages.

The messages are loaded on the basis of the current day first, once user scrolls up, previous messages will be loaded. This has been done to prevent the fetching of all the messages in one go which helps in optimization. Logout functionality is also there so that user can logout from the application.
